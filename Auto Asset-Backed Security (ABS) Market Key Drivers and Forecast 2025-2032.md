The growth in the ABS market is driven by increasing demand for vehicle financing, the rise in auto loan delinquencies, and the growing need for asset-backed investment products. These factors are contributing to the growth of the securitization of auto loans and leases, further fueling the expansion of the ABS market. Additionally, as financial institutions look for alternative investment opportunities, asset-backed securities provide an attractive option, especially in uncertain economic conditions. The increased adoption of ABS by institutional investors is also a key driver of market expansion.</p><p>Additionally, advancements in technology such as digitalization of loan origination and servicing, coupled with increased transparency in asset-backed securities, have positively impacted the market growth. The continued trend of automakers and financial institutions bundling auto loans and leases into securities to meet investor demand is expected to drive further growth. Rising vehicle sales, especially in emerging markets, and the growing shift toward electric vehicles are also likely to influence the Auto ABS market positively over the forecast period.
